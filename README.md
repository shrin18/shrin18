- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shrinish Donde
- I have a background in Electronics and Telecommunication and I am currently working as a software developer in one of the leading institutes in Germany (Fraunhofer). My job over the past years has given my hands-on experience with hardware and software related to telecommunications such as 5G, and Open RAN. Over time, I have developed a strong interest in how telecom keeps the world connected. I am also excited by the pace of innovation in this industry and want to be a part of that journey. I have also completed my Master in IT project management which gives me an edge over the others when it comes to dealing with decision making and managing projects.
